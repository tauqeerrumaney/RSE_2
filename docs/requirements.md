## Requirement Definition
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the project. The goal is to provide a detailed specification that ensures the workflow meets the necessary criteria for data management, analytical processing, data transformation, result generation, and automation.

### Functional Requirements

1. **Data Management**
   - The system must load, filter, and preprocess raw data to ensure it is clean and ready for analysis. This includes steps for noise reduction, artifact removal, and feature extraction.

2. **Analytical Processing**
   - The workflow must support various comparative analyses to identify significant differences and patterns within the data. These analyses should include comparisons based on predefined categories and criteria.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - The system should be capable of applying necessary transformations to the data, such as normalization and dimensionality reduction, to prepare it for more detailed analysis.

4. **Result Generation**
   - The workflow must generate visualizations and reports to summarize and present the findings clearly and comprehensively. These outputs should be suitable for inclusion in scientific documentation and presentations.

5. **Automation and Efficiency**
   - The system should automate as many steps as possible to enhance efficiency and reduce the need for manual intervention, ensuring repeatability and consistency in the analysis.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - The workflow should process data efficiently.
   - It must handle large datasets without performance degradation.

2. **Reliability**
   - Ensure accurate processing and analysis.
   - Handle errors gracefully and log issues.

3. **Usability**
   - Provide an intuitive interface for workflow configuration.
   - Include comprehensive documentation for each step.

4. **Maintainability**
   - Ensure steps are modular and maintainable.
   - Track changes with version control.

5. **Compatibility**
   - Ensure compatibility with various data formats and tools.
   - Ensure operability across different systems and environments.
