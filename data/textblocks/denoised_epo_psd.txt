This plot shows an analysis of the EEG data using power spectral density (PSD), with frequency on the x-axis and power on the y-axis. A PSD plot is a graphical representation of the distribution of power across various frequency components in the EEG signals. It highlights how much power is present at each frequency, allowing for the identification of dominant frequencies and the overall spectral profile of the EEG data.

The power spectral density plot enables the examination of neural oscillations and rhythmic brain activity, providing insights into the functional state of the brain. By analyzing the power distribution, researchers and clinicians can detect abnormalities, assess brain connectivity, and understand the underlying neural mechanisms of cognitive processes. Since plotting the PSD for all electrodes and all epochs in a single plot is infeasible, only a representative subset of the data is shown here. This focused approach helps in identifying specific frequency bands of interest and their correlation with different cognitive or behavioral states.
