This plot shows an analysis of the EEG signals from channels O1 and O2, which are located over the occipital lobe, during various cognitive tasks. The occipital lobe is primarily responsible for visual processing, and examining the differences in EEG signals from these channels can reveal important insights into lateralized brain activity.

The analysis involves computing the average EEG signal across multiple epochs for both channels O1 and O2. By comparing these average signals, we can identify differences in amplitude and pattern that correspond to different cognitive tasks. These differences can provide valuable information about how the left and right sides of the occipital lobe respond to visual stimuli and other tasks.

Only the averaged signals for channels O1 and O2 are shown here. The results are visualized in a line plot, with the average signals for O1 and O2 displayed for easy comparison.
