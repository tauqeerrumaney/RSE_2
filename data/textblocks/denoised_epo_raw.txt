This plot shows an analysis of the denoised raw EEG data, with recording electrodes on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. A plot of denoised raw EEG data is a graphical representation of the brain's electrical activity over time, after removing noise and artifacts that can obscure the true neural signals. This plot provides a clearer view of the underlying brain activity, facilitating more accurate analysis and interpretation.

The denoising process involves filtering out unwanted components such as muscle activity, eye movements, and electrical interference, which can contaminate the EEG recordings. By presenting the denoised data, this plot enables researchers and clinicians to observe the genuine neural oscillations and patterns, allowing for a better understanding of the brain's functional dynamics. Since displaying the denoised EEG for all electrodes over the entire recording period in a single plot is impractical, only a subset of the data is shown here. This approach ensures a detailed and focused examination of specific segments, highlighting the improvements achieved through the denoising process and providing a more accurate depiction of the brain's electrical activity.
