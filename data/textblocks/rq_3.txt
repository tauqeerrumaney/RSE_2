This plot shows an analysis of the event-related potential (ERP) for a specific cognitive task, comparing the ERP signals across channels AF3 (frontal), P7 (parietal), and O1 (occipital). ERPs are brain responses that are directly related to specific sensory, cognitive, or motor events. By examining the ERPs at different channels, we can understand how different brain regions respond to the same event.
The analysis involves loading the epochs data, selecting a single event type for comparison, and averaging the EEG signals for that event across the selected channels. This method highlights the differences in amplitude and timing of the ERP components at each channel, providing insights into the functional roles of different brain regions during the cognitive task. 
Since plotting the ERP for all channels simultaneously is impractical, only the selected channels (AF3, P7, and O1) are analyzed here.

The ERP plot displays the average signal amplitude (in microvolts) over time (in seconds) for the selected event type. This visualization helps in identifying the distinct ERP components and their variations across different brain regions, contributing to a better understanding of cognitive processing in the brain.
