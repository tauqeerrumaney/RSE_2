This plot shows an analysis of the kurtosis values for EEG signals across different epochs, focusing on channels FC6 (frontal-central), F4 (frontal), and F8 (frontal). Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. In the context of EEG signals, kurtosis can provide insights into the presence of outliers or extreme values in the data, which may indicate significant neural events or artifacts.

The kurtosis plot displays the kurtosis values on the y-axis and the epoch number on the x-axis, providing a clear view of how the "tailedness" of the EEG signal distribution varies across time. High kurtosis values may indicate periods with extreme values or outliers, suggesting significant neural dynamics or potential artifacts that need further investigation.
