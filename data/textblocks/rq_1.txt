This plot shows an analysis of the variability in power spectral density (PSD) across different frequency bands and events. The frequency bands are defined as follows: delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz). PSD is calculated using Welch's method for each frequency band and event, providing insights into how power varies across these bands in response to different events.

By analyzing the standard deviation of the PSD values across events, this plot highlights the frequency bands with the highest variability, indicating significant event-related changes in brain activity. This information is crucial for identifying which bands are most responsive to specific stimuli or conditions, thereby aiding in the understanding of underlying neural mechanisms. The resulting plot helps in identifying the frequency bands with the highest event-related variability, contributing to more targeted and effective EEG analysis.
