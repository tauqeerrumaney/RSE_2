This plot shows an analysis of the averaged EEG responses, with time on the x-axis and signal amplitude in microvolts (ÂµV) on the y-axis. A response plot is a graphical representation of the EEG signal averaged across multiple events or trials, highlighting the typical neural response to a specific stimulus or event. This averaging process reduces noise and emphasizes consistent patterns in the brain's activity.

The response plot enables the examination of event-related potentials (ERPs) and other significant neural responses that occur in relation to the presented stimuli. By averaging the signals, researchers and clinicians can identify key features such as the amplitude and latency of neural responses, providing insights into cognitive and sensory processing. This plot is particularly useful for studying the brain's reaction to repeated stimuli and understanding the temporal dynamics of neural activity.
