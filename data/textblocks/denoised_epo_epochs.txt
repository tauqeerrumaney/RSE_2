This plot shows an analysis of the EEG data epochs, with recording electrodes on the y-axis and epochs on the x-axis. An epoch plot is a graphical representation of time-segmented EEG signals, where each epoch corresponds to a specific time window triggered by a particular event or stimulus. This plot enables the examination of neural responses and patterns associated with these events, facilitating the identification of event-related potentials (ERPs) and other significant neural activities. Since plotting all electrodes and all epochs is infeasible for a single plot, only a subset of data is shown here.
