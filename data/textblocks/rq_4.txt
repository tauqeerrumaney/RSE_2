This plot shows an analysis of the time-frequency content of EEG signals by generating spectrograms for specified channels. A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a signal as it varies with time. This analysis provides insights into how the power of different frequency bands changes over the course of the recorded epochs.

Each spectrogram plot displays frequency on the y-axis and time on the x-axis, with color representing the power/frequency (dB/Hz). This visualization allows for the identification of transient events, oscillatory patterns, and other dynamic features in the EEG signal.
Since plotting spectrograms for all channels in a single plot is impractical, only the selected channels (F3 and FC6) are shown here.
This visualization helps in identifying frequency patterns and their temporal changes.
