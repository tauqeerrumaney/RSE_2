## Usage

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **[Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)**: For environment management.
- **[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**: For workflow management.
- **[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)**: For task automation. (Optional, but recommended)

### Running the Workflow

To run the entire workflow, execute the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```sh
make
```

This command will initiate the workflow and handle all necessary steps automatically. Upon the first run, a configuration file (`config/config.yaml`) will be created if it does not already exist.

Alternatively, you can copy the configuration file from the template and run the workflow manually:

```sh
cp config/config.yaml.example config/config.yaml
snakemake --use-conda --cores <num_cores>
```

### Configuration

The configuration file (`config/config.yaml`) contains settings that can be customized to suit your needs:

**Mock Flag (`mock`)**:
```yaml
mock: <true|false>
```
When set to `true`, the workflow uses a reduced dataset for testing purposes, allowing for quicker iterations during development.


**Artifacts (`artifacts`)**: 
```yaml
artifacts: "<artifact_index_1>,<artifact_index_2>,..."
```
Specifies a comma-separated list of artifact indices to exclude from processing, enhancing the flexibility in managing dataset quality.

**Section Titles (`section_titles`)**: 
```yaml
section_titles:
  <key>: <human-readable-title>
  # ...
```
Defines human-readable titles for each section of the generated report. The key used in this dictionary also helps in dynamically generating corresponding `.tex` files from data processing results. The order in the configuration file preserves the order in the final report.

#### Section Generation

- **Files such as `denoised_epo_epochs`, `denoised_epo_psd`, `denoised_epo_raw`, and `denoised_epo_response`**: These sections are generated by appending "_epochs", "_psd", "_raw", or "_response" to the basename of `.fif` datasets in the `temp` directory. Each section represents a different aspect of the dataset processing:
  - `_epochs`: Processes related to epoch extraction.
  - `_psd`: Analysis pertaining to the power spectral density.
  - `_raw`: Handling and examination of raw dataset files.
  - `_response`: Analysis related to evoked responses.

- **`ica_components`**: This section is generated as part of the ICA workflow and represents the components identified through ICA processing, which are crucial for identifying and removing artifacts from EEG data.

- **`RQ_1` to `RQ_5`**: Each key corresponds to a specific research question, with the workflow generating sections that provide answers or insights related to these questions based on the data analysis results. The numeric suffix indicates the specific question being addressed.

### Cleaning Up

To remove all generated output and clean the output directories, use the following command:

```sh
make clean
```

### Running Specific Steps

To run specific steps of the workflow, use Snakemake's targeted execution:
```sh
snakemake --use-conda <target_rule>
```

If you wish to run a script or command outside of the workflow, you can activate the specific Conda environment manually:
```sh
conda env create --name <environment_name> -f workflow/envs/<environment_file>.yaml
conda activate <environment_name>
# Run your script or command here
```

For example, to run the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) script:
```sh
conda env create -f workflow/envs/ica.yaml
conda activate rse24_project-two_ica
python workflow/scripts/ica.py temp/truncated_data.feather ica_epo.fif plot.png
```

### Developer Guide

For developers looking to contribute or maintain the project, the following commands are available:

**Lint the Workflow**:
Ensure you have `snakefmt`, `autopep8`, and `flake8` installed. Run the following command to format and check the code:

```sh
make lint
```

**Generate Workflow Diagram**:
Create a visual representation of the workflow with:

```sh
make plot
```
